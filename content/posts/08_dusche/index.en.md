The second day started much earlier than the kickoff in Hamburg yesterday. We
left the camp ground in Sandhammaren along with a huge group of other
participants at around 7 or 8. The goal was to get past JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping and have a
nice ride along the coast of Lake VÃ¤ttern.

The search for the largest erratic Boulder brought us to the Omberg and we
learned that there was an unsuccessful expedition in 1897 which wanted to
explore the Arctic in a hot air balloon.

Tonight we found a serene spot at the shore of a small lake Â which we were
introduced to by a local. We asked him whether we could stay in his backyard
just for the night but instead he brought us here! What an awesome guy ðŸ™‚

The next couple of days will be more stressful. We have to get to the Lofoten
in time for the midnight sun party. I still hope to update all of you with news
from our adventure!
in the meantime you can head over to our fundraiser and donate a few pennies to
our friends at Die Arche and Serve the City! Just click on the donation button
in the menu.

See you next time, love and hugs from Scandinavia,

Jan
