We got one step closer to our goal of arriving safe and sound back in Hamburg,
thanks to our sponsor Emigholz. They support us with two new tires and a check
up for Bob! The entire team is thankful for the support and therefore we want
to introduce them a bit.
Emigholz offers a full service coverage for your carâ€™s tires. It has 18 service
stations all around Emden, Sittensen, Cuxhaven and Bremen.
