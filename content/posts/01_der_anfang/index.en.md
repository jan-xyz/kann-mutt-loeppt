# Welcome to our Blog!
Somehow you made it to our page, it will be come a place for us to keep you
update on our trip around the Baltic Sea. That’s right! We are going to circle
around the Baltic, Ines, Christian and I.
Last week we were officially accepted as one of the Teams in [the Baltic Sea Circle](http://balticrally.superlative-adventure.com/) 
We will keep you in the loop on our adventure to find the right car, do our
preparation and hopefully find a fourth team member!
Until next time,
Jan
